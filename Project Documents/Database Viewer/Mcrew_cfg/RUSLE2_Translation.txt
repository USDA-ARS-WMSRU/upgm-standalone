#
# This is the translation file for converting NRCS RUSLE2 "skeleton" files to WEPS files. The entries are
# consulted when a RUSLE2 operation or crop is not found in the WEPS databases when the skeleton files are being imported.
# There are 3 columns seperated by pipe| characters.
#
#     Column 1 - The RUSLE2 name of an operation or crop
#
#     Column 2 - What to do when it is encountered, currently the 3 options are:
#                             rename - change name of operation or crop to match a WEPS value 
#                             delete - if name is an operation it removes the entire line
#                                      if name is a crop it deletes only the crop portion of entry
#                renameAndDeleteCrop - changes name of operation, if a crop is part of the entry the crop field is cleared.
#Hmm, looks like we need a "renameAndAddCrop" option also - LEW
#
#     Column 3 - The WEPS name to be used.
#                If column 1 is a crop name and column 2 is set to "rename", then "none" specified in column 3
#                will clear the crop field
# Lines in the file that start with a # are considered comment lines.

# Notes from Jim's email message to me on Jan 7, 2005 - LEW
#
# In the rusle2 translation file if the rusle2 name maps to a vegetation then a 'delete' will delete that vegetation entry from
# any weps records, it will still leave the operation - just the crop column will be empty. The same applies if the action is
# 'rename|none' and the rusle2 name is a vegetation - the weps crop column becomes empty.
#
# There is a new action you can put in the rusle2 translation file: 'renameAndDeleteCrop' which applies an operation rename and
# then blanks the crop entry if one is present with this operation.
#
# For manually doing crop removals the first entry in the crop dropdown list is now blank which effectively clears the crop
# field if this is selected. When the data is converted to a weps management file these crop entries are not included. 
#

# Example line that would remove the RUSLE2 operation from the generated WEPS man file (based upon a RUSLE2 operation name)

#
#Based upon Jim's documentation, the following two lines perform the same function at this time.
# Example line that would remove only the RUSLE2 crop from the generated WEPS man file (based upon a RUSLE2 crop name)
