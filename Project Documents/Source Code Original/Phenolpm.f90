!     boots - booting growth stage. this array includes daynum, year,

!     cname - crop name.
!     daa - days after anthesis.
!     dae - days after emergence.

!              and non- stressed conditions,required to reach each growth
!              stage of the current crop.
!     emrgflg - a flag to determine if the new emerge subroutine should be
!               called (emrgflg=1) or to proceed with the weps/upgm method
!               of achieving emergence (emrgflg=0).
!     ems - day when emergence occurred. this array includes daynum, year,
